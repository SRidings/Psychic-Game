# Psychic-Game
**Psychic-Game (Basic)**

**The Psyhic-Game has the following features**

1. _The computer randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chos

2. _Guess what letter I'm thinking of

3. _Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

4. _Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

5. _Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

6. _Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Displays until the user either wins or loses.)

7. _When the player wins, it increases the Wins counter and starts the game over again (without refreshing the page).

8. _When the player loses, kit increase the Losses counter and restarts the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
