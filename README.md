# Psychic-Game
**Psychic-Game (Basic)**

**The Psyhic-Game has the following features**

_1. The computer randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the computer has chosen.

_2. Guess what letter I'm thinking of - Guess the letter the computer is thinking of

_3. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

_4. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

_5. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

_6. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Displays until the user either wins or loses.)

_7. When the player wins, it increases the Wins counter and starts the game over again (without refreshing the page).

_8. When the player loses, kit increase the Losses counter and restarts the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
